            <p class= "first">Twelfth night is a romantic comedy about two separated twins, Viola and Sebastian, who make their way to the kingdom of Illyria. Viola disguises herself as a boy named 'Cesario' and is employed by the reigning Duke Orsino. Orsino’s love interest is the Lady Olivia, who will not reciprocate his feelings, as she is mourning the death of her father. Orsino sends Viola to woo Lady Olivia on his behalf but Olivia ends up falling for Viola, who she believes to be Cesario. Meanwhile chance brings Sebastian to the court of Olivia who makes him marry her, mistaking him for Viola aka Cesario.</p>

               
            <p> A healthy rigmarole ensues till all is cleared up, with the duke finding new love with Viola. The antics of Sir Toby Belch, Sir Andrew Aguecheek and Maria, Olivia's servant, are also noteworthy. Their tormenting of Malvolio was often considered to be the more prominent storyline when the play was first performed, while modern readers and viewers tend to see Viola's arc as the more important strand of plot. </p>
