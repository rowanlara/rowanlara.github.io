			<p class="character">Sir Toby</p>

			<p class="character">Maria</p>
			<p class="prose">He hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, ‘tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave</p>

			<p class="character">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="prose">Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit</p>
			<p class="character">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="verseline">No question</p>

			<p class="character">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="prose">Faith, I’ll home to-morrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me; the Count himself here hard by woos her</p>
			<p class="character">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose">She’ll none o’ th’ Count; she’ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear’t. Tut, there’s life in’t, man</p>

			<p class="prose">And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria</p>
			<p class="character">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose">Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before ‘em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was form’d under the star of a galliard</p>
			<p class="character">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="prose">Ay, ‘tis strong, and it does indifferent well in flame-colour’d stock. Shall we set about some revels?</p>

Bid the dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that’s mended is but patch’d; virtue that transgresses is but patch’d with sin, and sin that amends is but patch’d with virtue.If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty’s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away</p>

Look you now, he’s out of his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagg’d. I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools’ zanies</p>
			<p class="character">Olivia</p>
			<p class="prose">O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distemper’d appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets.

			<p class="character">Malvolio</p>

I would be loath to cast away my speech; for, besides that it is excellently well penn’d, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage</p>

			<p class="character">Olivia</p>
			<p class="prose">It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and allow’d your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you.

You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I call’d Roderigo; my father was that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour; if the heavens had been pleas’d, would we had so ended!

			<p class="prose">No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church</p>
			<p class="character">Viola</p>

			<p class="prose">You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a chev’ril glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turn’d outward!</p>

			<p class="character">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose">No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly; she will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and fools are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings- the husband’s the bigger. I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words</p>

			<p class="character">Malvolio</p>
			<p class="prose">O, ho! do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. ‘Cast thy humble slough,’ says she. ‘Be opposite with kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity’ and consequently sets down the manner how, as: a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have lim’d her; but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now- ‘Let this fellow be look’d to.’ ‘Fellow,’ not ‘Malvolio’ nor after my degree, but ‘fellow.’ Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance- What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked</p>

Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour, and drive the gentleman- as know his youth will aptly receive it- into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices</p>

Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly</p>
			<p class="character">Viola</p>
			<p class="prose">You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me; my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man</p>
			<p class="character">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose">You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you; therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal</p>
			<p class="character">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline">I pray you, sir, what is he?</p>
			<p class="character">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose">He is knight, dubb’d with unhatch’d rapier and on carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorc’d three; and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob-nob is his word- give’t or take’t</p>
			<p class="character">Viola</p>
			<p class="prose">I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour; belike this is a man of that quirk</p>

			<p class="prose">Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury; therefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him; therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that’s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you</p>
			<p class="character">Viola</p>
			<p class="prose">This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you do me this courteous office as to know of the knight what my offence to him is: it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose</p>

			<p class="character">Fabian</p>
			<p class="prose">Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is indeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can</p>
			<p class="character">Viola</p>

			<p class="character">Malvolio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Madam, you have done me wrong,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Notorious wrong</p>
			<p class="character">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have I, Malvolio? No</p>
			<p class="character">Malvolio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter</p>
			<p class="verseline">You must not now deny it is your hand;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or say ‘tis not your seal, not your invention;</p>
			<p class="verseline">You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And tell me, in the modesty of honour,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Bade me come smiling and cross-garter’d to you,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To put on yellow stockings, and to frown</p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, acting this in an obedient hope,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And made the most notorious geck and gul</p>
			<p class="verseline">That e’er invention play’d on? Tell me why</p>
			<p class="character">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline">Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Though, I confess, much like the character;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But out of question ‘tis Maria’s hand</p>
			<p class="verseline">And now I do bethink me, it was she</p>
			<p class="verseline">First told me thou wast mad; then cam’st in smiling,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And in such forms which here were presuppos’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content;</p>
			<p class="verseline">This practice hath most shrewdly pass’d upon thee,</p>
			<p class="verseline">But, when we know the grounds and authors of it,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of thine own cause</p>
			<p class="character">Fabian</p>
			<p class="verseline">Good madam, hear me speak,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come</p>
			<p class="verseline">Taint the condition of this present hour,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which I have wond’red at. In hope it shall not,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Most freely I confess myself and Toby</p>
			<p class="verseline">Set this device against Malvolio here,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts</p>
			<p class="verseline">We had conceiv’d against him. Maria writ</p>
			<p class="verseline">The letter, at Sir Toby’s great importance,</p>
			<p class="verseline">In recompense whereof he hath married her</p>
			<p class="verseline">How with a sportful malice it was follow’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,</p>
			<p class="verseline">If that the injuries be justly weigh’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">That have on both sides pass’d</p>
			<p class="character">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline">Alas, poor fool, how have they baffl’d thee!</p>
			<p class="character">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose">Why, ‘Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.’ I was one, sir, in this interlude- one Sir Topas, sir; but that’s all one. ‘By the Lord, fool, I am not mad!’ But do you remember- ‘Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? An you smile not, he’s gagg’d’? And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges</p>
			<p class="character">Malvolio</p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll be reveng’d on the whole pack of you</p>
			<p class="stagedirection">Exit</p>
			<p class="character">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline">He hath been most notoriously abus’d</p>
			<p class="character">Duke</p>
			<p class="verseline">Pursue him, and entreat him to a peace;</p>
			<p class="verseline">He hath not told us of the captain yet</p>
			<p class="verseline">When that is known, and golden time convents,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A solemn combination shall be made</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,</p>
			<p class="verseline">We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;</p>
			<p class="verseline">For so you shall be while you are a man;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But when in other habits you are seen,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Orsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen</p>
			<p class="stagedirection">Exeunt all but the Clown</p>
			<p class="verseline">Clown sings</p>
			<p class="verseline">When that I was and a little tiny boy,</p>
			<p class="verseline">With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A foolish thing was but a toy,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For the rain it raineth every day</p>
			<p class="verseline">But when I came to man’s estate,</p>
			<p class="verseline">With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For the rain it raineth every day</p>
			<p class="verseline">But when I came, alas! to wive,</p>
			<p class="verseline">With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</p>
			<p class="verseline">By swaggering could I never thrive,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For the rain it raineth every day</p>
			<p class="verseline">But when I came unto my beds,</p>
			<p class="verseline">With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</p>
			<p class="verseline">With toss-pots still had drunken heads,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For the rain it raineth every day</p>
			<p class="verseline">A great while ago the world begun,</p>
			<p class="verseline">With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</p>
			<p class="verseline">But that’s all one, our play is done,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And we’ll strive to please you every day</p>
			<p class="stagedirection">Exit</p>
